| Feature                | Description |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Core Algorithm         | Rule 110 Cellular Automaton with dynamic inner/outer universe|
| Seed Derivation        | XOR of SHA-256 hashes of multiple secrets (passwords, timestamp, iteration, etc.) |
| Entropy Injection      | Seed-derived bits XOR-injected into CA state per iteration   |
| Universe Initialization| ChaCha20 CSPRNG, seed-derived key/nonce, high-entropy start  |
| Key Derivation         | SHA-512 hash of final CA state after N iterations            |
| State Sensitivity      | One-bit change in any secret yields a new state/key          |
| Forward/Backward Secrecy| Compromise of state does not reveal previous/next states    |
| Key Independence       | Keys are uncorrelated between iterations                    |
| State Verification     | Optional fingerprinting (hashing) of CA state per iteration  |
| Quantum Resistance     | Computational irreducibility, no known quantum speedup       |
| Metadata Security      | Outer universe hides size/location, ciphertext leaks nothing |
| Extensibility          | Modular CA/seed/entropy design                              |

## System Overview

CAultron110 is a cryptographic engine based on a 1D Rule 110 cellular automaton, reinforced by:

- Multi-secret, high-entropy seed derivation ([Spec 3](spec%203%20-%20Seed%20Derivation.md))
- Dynamic inner/outer universe architecture ([Spec 2](spec%202%20-%20Data%20Types%20and%20Structure.md), [Spec 5](spec%205%20-%20Universe%20Evolution.md))
- ChaCha20-based noise initialization ([Spec 5](spec%205%20-%20Universe%20Evolution.md))
- Per-iteration entropy injection ([Spec 4](spec%204%20-%20Entropy%20Injection.md))
- Deterministic, irreversible CA evolution ([Spec 5](spec%205%20-%20Universe%20Evolution.md))
- Key derivation via SHA-512 ([Spec 6](spec%206%20-%20Key%20Derivation.md))
- Forward and backward secrecy ([Spec 7](spec%207%20-%20Forward%20and%20Backward%20Secrecy.md))
- State verification ([Spec 8](spec%208%20-%20State%20Verification.md))
- Quantum resistance ([Spec 9](spec%209%20-%20Quantum%20Resistance.md))
- Systematic risk analysis ([Spec 10](spec%2010%20-%20Attack%20Scenarios%20and%20Mitigations.md))

All mechanisms are deterministic and reproducible for the same inputs, with a minimal memory footprint and high theoretical entropy.

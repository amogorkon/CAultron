CAultron is a cryptographic engine built on a single-universe, one-dimensional cellular automaton, with all entropy injection and initialization performed via ChaCha20. The system is defined by the following key properties and mechanisms:

- **Single-Universe Model:** All operations occur within a single, high-entropy universe, eliminating the complexity and attack surface of multi-universe designs.
- **Meta-Rule System:** Each evolution step uses a dynamically selected meta-rule, encoded in 28 bits and derived from the seed, providing a vast and unpredictable rule space (see Spec 4).
- **Seed and Entropy Handling:** Seeds are derived from multiple secrets (including a cryptographically secure random bitstring) using XOR of SHA-256 hashes, ensuring high entropy and resistance to brute-force attacks (see Spec 3). All entropy injection is performed via ChaCha20, and seed bits are used for both rule selection and evolution scheduling.
- **Dual Point Derivation:** Key derivation is performed using the Dual Point Derivation method (see Spec 6), where the output key is the XOR of two SHA-512 hashes: one at a random pre-final evolution and one at the final state. The random evolution index is determined by seed bits, making the process highly unpredictable.
- **Forward and Backward Secrecy:** The use of dynamic meta-rules and per-step entropy injection ensures that compromise of any state or key does not reveal previous or future states/keys (see Spec 7).
- **Quantum Resistance:** The system is computationally irreducible, with no known quantum speedup for CA state prediction or key derivation. Each step is dependent on secrets and the meta-rule schedule, and entropy is preserved through universe management and injection.
- **Extensibility and Modularity:** The architecture supports modular extension of CA rules, entropy sources, and verification mechanisms.

CAultron’s design ensures that all cryptographic properties—confidentiality, integrity, forward/backward secrecy, and quantum resistance—are achieved through a combination of deterministic, high-entropy processes and dynamic, seed-driven rule selection. The result is a robust, future-proof cryptographic primitive suitable for a wide range of secure applications.
